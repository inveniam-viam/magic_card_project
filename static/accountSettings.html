<!-- This is what we call a standard HTML boilerplate code.
Similar to having a template that we can reuse.
This actually resembles the template molds which used to be used to print books back in the days of the printing press.
It's called a boilerplate because steam boilers back in the day would have a plate with their manufacturer's name.
So much for history, eh?

<!-- DOCTYPE stands for document type, and tells the browser to render the file as a HTML5 file

The html tag signifies that everything within is html code.

It usually contains a head tag and a body tag, respectively denoted by <head> and <body>.

The head tag contains information about the web page and tells the browser how to handle the webpage.

The title might tell what the title is. Here, we have just called it Jared's Personal Site.

Meta elements provide extra metadata to the HTML document. Here it tells the browser that everything in our HTML document is to be rendered in the UTF-8 format.

You might sometimes observe that on clicking some link which your Bulgarian buddy sent you, you see a whole bunch of garbled characters. This phenomenon is called

Mojibake (Japanese for character transformation) and happens when something is rendered using the incorrect characterset.

The main cause of Mojibake usually is the fact that different languages encode symbols in different ways, causing them to spit out the nonsense we see.

UTF-8 is the standard encoding used in HTML5 since it includes all the languages too.

Using the UTF8 encoding in the boilerplate ensures that your website is rendered properly, even to visitors from other countries / other international browsers.


You can also add other metadata fields, such as description or keywords to tell search engines more about your website/page.

Say for instance, you add a meta field such as <meta name="description" content = "Jared is an undergraduate student at Drexel University."

What happens on searching say, Google, for your website is that the description you see in the Search results would be the same as whatever
you fed to the description content in the meta data.

BASICALLY, HOW TO DISPLAY INFO IN THE SEARCH INDEX BOIS.
-->

<!-- While trying to italicize your description, you were searching for documentation.

  There are two options to italicize text: the <i> tag and the emphasis tag (<em>). These two tags necessarily do the same

  from a visual standpoint, but the i tag is used to plainly italicize text whereas the em tag is used to draw emphasis on the text.


  Same goes for boldface: whether to use <b> or to use <strong.
  -->

<!-- Lists

  ul stands for unordered lists (think of it as a bullet list for now)

  Start your list with the <ul> tag. And then for the contents of your list, enclose each list element within the li tags (<li></li>).

  Similarly, ol stands for ordered lists.

  To implement ordered lists, follow the same things as for the unordered lists, except use ol.

  There's a couple other things that can be done with ordered lists by taking advantage of its attributes.

  Example 1: Roman Numeral based OLs

  Just use <ol type="i"> </ol>

  Example 2: Lists that start from some arbitrary number.

  Just use <ol start = "0"> </ol> to get a list that goes from 0,1,2...

  -->

<!-- Images

   The image tag is actually another self-closing tag, meaning you dont need to use a closing tag.

   But you can't just embed an image by just using the image tag. This should make sense since to embed an image, we would rendered

   to specify some kind of source or URL or whatever for the image that we are attempting to embed.

   So, here is the syntax:

       <img src = "jared.png" alt= "jared smiling" />

       This is an image tag with the src (source) attribute pointing to the image jared.png, which is in the same working directory in this case.

       The alt attribute will be the text that is going to be displayed in the event the image fails to load. It's also useful in helping search engines to

       index and rank your webpage.

    -->

<!-- Hyperlinks

  HyperText is basically nothing but a bunch of text documents that can be linked together by hyperlinks.

  Click on a link, be taken to the next page and so forth.

  What are these links made of?

  To add a link, add an <a href="#"> tag right in front of the text you want to link over and an </a> right after that.

  the href is nothing but a hyperlink you're going to be pointed towards to.

  <a href = "LINK DESTINATION"> Link Text</a>

  Adding the download attribute after the a in the anchor tag forces the browser to download whatever that is being clicked on to one's local machine.


      -->

<!-- Tables

      Tables are a super effective way of presenting data, be it just presenting actual tabular data, or be it just displaying things with uniform indents.

      A table can be created in HTML using the <table> </table> tags.

      Working with a table is a little weird since we're only going to be using the row elements to create the table.

      To create a row, use the <tr></tr> tags.

      To add data, use the <td></td> tags.

      To add a header, use the <th></th> tags.

      It's always a good idea to separate the header and data portions by using the <thead></thead> and <tbody></tbody> tags.
